## About S.
*I am not a cat person.* **Jot that down in your copybook if you subconsciously desire a cat to interupt and change your life one day.** 
His name is Sage, and he is 12 weeks old. If I'd have known I would be applying for coding school, I wouldn't have downloaded the fish app to keep him busy. Now he wants to "help" me learn **GitHub**.
